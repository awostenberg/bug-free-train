One of the flaws of the current social media titans is that the
algorithms that curate the feed are proprietary and secret.
We social coders can strike a blow for mental health by open
sourcing everything from the beginning and developing in a fish
bowl.

So why not open source the MVP this Christmas season?

Objection 1. Chief has no bandwidth.

Objection 2. Code asbuilt is not measurably better than what's already available in opensource for social media.

Question 1. is opensource relevant to mental health as such?

Reply 1. Probably not for private 1:1, privacy. 
But if somebody is rating 10,000 posts with regards to mental
health as a training set that will then curate my feed, why not
share it? Sunshine. Science!

Secrecy seems contrary.

On the other hand, Tevya, consider the index of forbidden books.
That is, better not to recommend a book than to have an open list
of books being recommended against.

But again, this is data rather than algorithm per se.
Now if the data were open, I could shop around for other
curators, rather than trust one size fits all.
Trust but verify!

Question 2. what's a social coder?

Reply 2. Just like a social drinker, but with code. Unlike social media, which is asynchronous text, we social coders collaborate in realitme, over code. Joy.
