Given I have chosen asynchronous collaboration (I make a work product and later seek feedback from other people) it can be tempting to have unstructured review, e.g. “any comments”

And this can work when the reviewers number one or two, and are well prepared. 

But when they are many, or unprepared (for example, have not read the item to review) a time-boxed structured review can be more effective.

Five star review is one such option.


## five star review ageenda
Objective: five star review of _

Agenda: 15 minutes of silent reading and private note taking(*)

Three questions roll call (**)
1. what is your star rating 1..5?
2. Why that number?
   -    Yellow hat. Positive. Sunny. Benefits.
   - Black hat. Cautious. Critical. Devil’s advocate.

3. What one thing, if done, would raise your rating?

Dismissed!  I make no attempt to address objections at this time. I want to give us time to think. To sleep on it.

For we now have a baseline measured by five star rating, the one to best, if that be possible, in the time allotted.


What comes next depends on the decision model. Options:

|nodel|description|
|---|---|
|a|leader decides with no input from team
|b|leader decides with input from team
|c|whole team decides in consensus
|d|every man decides for himself 


If we’re operating on a (B) decision model, I’ve collected their input, and will revise the artifact accordingly.

If model (C), many options, but we have a baseline. Is the next revision better as measured by five star review? 

If model (D), we have a sentiment histogram from those ratings, that each may go his way, informed.


 I stick around in the room, reviewing and lightly refining the notes for grammar, spelling, so I have something a little more readable. I might post that verbatim to teams meeting notes section.

I might begin revising the artifact to respond to feedback. In the case of an [ADR](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html) I’m looking for the 3 best black hat thoughts so I can steelman the objection and let it change my thinking.

(*) Silent read time depends on length. An adult reads 200-300 words/minute, but we need to allow think time. I’ve found 15 minutes for a 2000 word ADR suffices; 2 minutes for a three sentence draft story. 

However long, I start a timer and text a message like “brb 5m”, and leave the room (camera on showing an empty room) while they read, silently.

(**) by roll call, I mean put the first question to each person, note response on a text pad which all see because I’m sharing my screen.

```
For each Q in Questions
   For each P in Persons
      Ask P the Q; transcribe whatever he said, without judging.
