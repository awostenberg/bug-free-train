## I. Introduction
Most engineering teams come together as a team only during meetings, as we are today, while the productive work is done alone.

Outside of engineering, very little of what we do would be recognized as true teamwork.  Consider, for example, the tuba ensemble in which everybody played alone in separate rooms… and came together as a whole ensemble only for the daily standup. Or consider a football team in which each athlete played with a ball by himself on an isolated patch of the field… and came together as a team only for the huddle.

We social coders side with musicians and athletes  in humbly challenging the engineering status quo: what if we programmed together as a whole team? 

[Software teaming](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Teaming-Programming-Whole-Team-Approach-ebook/dp/B0BLL5WTKM) is like pair programming but with more people and of more diverse skills, for making software is more than just programming. 

Given  the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, if we program as a true team, why not quote a team programming rate?

Furthermore, an hourly rate focuses on effort expended not value delivered. On scrum the unit of value is the completed sprint — not the hour expended. Why not price it per sprint?

## II. First sprint experiment 

In the first sprint of Advent we conducted an experiment in software teaming, with the smallest possible team of n=2, and an occasional guest joining us, for an n>2 session.  

You may have seen over slack the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) for that first sprint Increment of $8400.

Do you wonder at that figure? Here is the napkin math.

Short answer: 2×2×12*$175


|units|what|
|----|----|
|2|people in session (“pair programming”)|
|2|hour work sessions|
|12|consecutive work days (“long sprint”)|
|$175|per man-hour (1/1000 annual salary)|
|====|
|$8400| MSRP|


Why $175/hour? Each sprint can be thought of as a standalone project. So I applied a rule of thumb for short-term contract work of an hourly of 1/1000 the annual salary ask. 


## III. Generalized rate card 

Value comes from one completed feature at a time and while in scrum the *Increment* delivered each *Sprint* is the unit of value, we team programmers can sometimes deliver value in as little as a session. How?

Like a multi core processor, we scale up and down the number of people depending on the work. 

When all the brilliant minds work on the same problem at the same time on the same computer, we have more joy and get more done because we don’t stay stuck for long. 

But for that gain we need *all* the brilliant minds, and sometimes that’s more than 2, but we don’t always know how many up front.

How can we reduce the likelihood of the session being waste due to waiting (when we know what we don’t know) or rework (when we don’t know what we don’t know)?  

We include more than two in the session.

Here is the rate generalized to n>2 programming, for both classic two week sprints and single sessions.

|n|2|3|4|
|--|--|--|--|
|per-session|700|1,050|1,400|
|per-sprint|7,000|10,500|14,000|

## IV. value for value

I’m told the offer won’t be in USD as above, but in units of private equity.

Now value is subjective. The stock has no value to me. Therefore the envisioned offer is to me 0, which is equivalent to pro-bono work, or a maybe a loss-leader.  I am willing to work this third sprint on a pro-bono basis.

If on sprint demo day the Chief cares to tip us as he might a Christmas tuba ensemble playing *God rest ye merry gentlemen* downtown on the Pearl street mall, tip us. Bitcoin accepted.

If the Chief wants to hire us, make an offer. USD accepted. 

## V. Demo day redo?

When it came time to show a demo of the work of the pair that first sprint, we were declined.  I take that as a signal by the Chief that no value was expected.  

Perhaps the timing was bad, or we were moving too fast. For how could a new crew learning python possibly produce anything of value in just two weeks and with no access to the proprietary code repo?

Chief, I would like to offer a 30 minute demo of our work of the first sprint, today. In gratitude for your time, on behalf of the crew, I will tip you in bitcoin just to view it.

Deal?
