One problem of the incumbant social media giants is they are walled gardens programming to a proprietary protocol.
This stiffles competition for the best client, the best server, for a given audience. 
Contrast this with email, of which there are diverse clients and servers,
all programming to an open protocol.

Just as proprietary email servers interoperate through the open SMTP protocol, 
and a variety of web servers and browsers interoperate through the open HTTPS protocol, 
so social media client and relay can interoperate through an open protocol.

Programming to an existing open social media protocol benefits from network effects 
while freeing us for the discipined persuit of less: that which truly differentiates us (perhaps curating the feed?). 

So why not build on an existing open social media protocol? Why not [nostr](https://nostr.com/)?
