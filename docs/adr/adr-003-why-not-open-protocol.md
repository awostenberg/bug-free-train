adr-003-why-not-open-protocol

One problem of the incumbant social media giants is they are walled gardens programming to a proprietary protocol.
This stiffles competition for the best client, the best server, for a given audience. 
Contrast this with email, of which there are diverse clients and servers,
all programming to an open protocol.

Just as proprietary email servers interoperate through the open SMTP protocol, 
and a variety of web servers and browsers interoperate through the open HTTPS protocol, 
so social media client and relay can interoperate through an open protocol.

Programming to an existing open social media protocol benefits from network effects 
while freeing us for the discipined persuit of less: that which truly differentiates us (perhaps curating the feed?). 

So why not build on an existing open social media protocol? Why not [nostr](https://nostr.com/)?



*objection 1:* nostr private key management
- UX/UI issues - no hurdle for cypherpunks (e.g. pgp; bitcoin)
        but for laymen? Supporting this for hundreds of thousands of lay  'dudes'
        and 'gal's is likely to be one of the hardest things we would have to solve; look at iMessage for an option;

  
*objection 2:* pace of innovation
- faster to innovate on proprietary protocol 
than on open

*objection 3:* dm time delays?
- quantify "too long" (e.g. 100ms?)  
  - a) will always come (guaranteed delivery)
  - b) within 4-5s at 99.0% confidence


*objection 4:* message retention on relay?
