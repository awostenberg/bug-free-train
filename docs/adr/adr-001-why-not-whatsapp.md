# why not whatsapp?

MJM: Ok, W, given you're wanting social media for the smallest social unit, the family, and granted, group text has it's limitations, why not whatsapp?

W: I heard it was owned by the chineese, and it is centralized and permissioned (I need a username/password), rather than text, which is permissionless. For example, my daughter Sarah stood up a "secret doggie chat" the other day, invited other members of family who like dogs and seeing daily dog pics. She did not need to ask permission.

M: On the contrary, whats app you just need your phone, works like a text. you just go and install the app.


W: ok, but whatabout chinese ownership? 

M: It's owned by meta.

W: I'm curious on the onboarding; you could what's app me now?

M: sure, I'll send an invitation

W: "access you contacts"? I don't think so.

M: don't blame you, but it is interesting

W: no e-mail for now. I'm in. That was easy, except for asking for phone number.

W: I understand why, though, if they're going to text me.

W: Adding M to contacts in order to message.  Sending message

M: it came through Whatsapp

W: not as texts?

M: no, separate in Whatsapp

M: In the past... maybe if I added my google account, it automaticall 
Included a whatsapp option under contact along with text and phone.
(I just reinstalled it on a new phone.)

W: merits consideration. Let's run a little experiment.

## yellow hat

- add people to a group rather than a new group; history of that;
- end to encryption for 1:1 msg; (but, we infer, not for group chat)
- M's family uses it for this one convo; others ,generic.
- onboarding surprisingly smooth & fast
- learned brother & SIL use in Peru
- didn't have to hand over email or contacts /minimalist
- iPhone/Android agnostic
- messages *and calls* end-to-end encrypted (?)

## white hat
- meta owns it
- widely used in Latin America, where internet access cheaper than phone
- text photos like SMS

## black hat
- why does it need my phone number? It's not texting me
- clearly centralized, unlike nostr https://nostr.com/ and  https://simplex.chat/, which are decentralized
- is there a reason it's not more popular (in US)?
- pure text is not good for brainstorming and taking polls, e.g. Mom's bday dinner


## green hat
- could it be used for Secret Baby Chat, planning Mom's 80+th bday dinner,
	Monday morning men's coffee?
	"named group chats" generally; 
		this cannot be done with text chat, unless /everybody/ is on iPhone
  - evidently there as a way, for there are instructions on how to do it.
- W: I wonder, does WhatsApp have plugins? E.g., in bday planning, wanted to float ideas and take a poll
