# White hat
- two participants
- opened with prayer
- first half: finish FactorPrimes in Java
- second half: reacquainted with Python
    - needed to activate .venv *before* ``pip install``
    - add "iv" and "ix" optimizations for roman_numerals
# Yellow hat
- top of hour break when not sure how to proceed
    - change to Python probably wouldn't have happened without it
    - "hammock driven development"
- speed of Python build/run refreshing after Java
- just nice to continue work on a project that had been left hanging
