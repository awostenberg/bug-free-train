## White Hat
* two participants
* C Arabic from Roman
* Make file
* refactored to recursive algorithm
* symlink to include library .c file in src dir with other .c
    * (required for minimal changes to generic Makefile)
* diagnosed
    * runaway recursion due to lack of empty string base case
    * incorrect return due to uninitialized variable

## Yellow hat
* C is fun (like horse-drawn plow?)
* Just getting back into it
* Nice to see pair buddy moves: symlink, diagnosis of bugs
