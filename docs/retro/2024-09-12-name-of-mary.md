 - finish fizzbuzz
   - cleaned it up - remove duplication
     - ``@beforeEach`` to remove duplication in test code
   - noticed can't do named lambdas easily in Java
 - began factorPrimes
   - for small primes (2, 3) complete and shippable (maybe) 
     - no don't ship -- fails internal code review 
   - learned list of integers ``ArrayList<Integer>`` 
     - and how to init it to known values
# black hat
 - when M share application window dialog boxes (e.g. refactor), A can't see it
 - not comfortable of list typing notation / java generics (don't understand it)
 - A just can't remember markdown square round bracket rule (squares for human, round for machine)

# yellow hat
 - continuous testing works on M box
 - very find grain TDD (write a line of test, a line of code)
