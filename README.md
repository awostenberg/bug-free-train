## day 8

### white hat
    Michael had 3.11 python going
    Alan tried desktop gather town - sound as good or better
    factor to googol
	learned // integer division
	python float precision probably 80 bits
	integers apparently infinite
    used recursive algorithm
    c# convention of "try_" for predicate function seemed better
    still wondering why mob.sh timer doesn't use default

### yellow hat

    Alan: good quality sound
    faster start, because tools just worked (not new, not failing)
    Michael fact that Alan is satisfied with factor
    M: Python's integer division operator is pretty cute
    A: liked that M solved it
    
### green hat. 
    we got value of prime factors; move onto something new tomorrow  (roman numerals)


## day 7
Tuesday. Day 7.
    Tuesday. .. mike could not her alan, nor see, maybe it was alan vpn; refresh GT and it seems to be working...

    GT sound is dead.... dunno why.. going with ma belll iPhone..

    GT sound works over Chrome, but A can't share screen (permissions). granted. Recap:
        Now on chrome, alan can share screen, alan can talk, mike can hear, alan can see mike, can't hear Mike over GT... hm...
        I guess 30 minutes in... revert to ma bell..

    Alan here, 2nd time; working to get mike set...

    Michael

### white hat
    pytest working on both machines
    ran a few tests up to 4
    use mob git handover for collaboration
    each got to use own IDE
    python "match" requires 3.11
    2 hours, 2 participants
    used some rudimentary markdown for README.md
    used vertically split screen (Michael)

### yellow
    all white hat stuff was great
    esp. mob.sh handover 7 -10min increments: flow


Mon. Day 6. Blink retro.

# white hat
   got M and A working on git handover 
   went to telephone sound -- gt unrelable A

# yellow hat
	push mob timer at end! 
	new tool -- no more VS code liveshare  dependency.

# green
	tomorrow. primes
