## day 7
Tuesday. Day 7.
    Tuesday. .. mike could not her alan, nor see, maybe it was alan vpn; refresh GT and it seems to be working...

    GT sound is dead.... dunno why.. going with ma belll iPhone..

    GT sound works over Chrome, but A can't share screen (permissions). granted. Recap:
        Now on chrome, alan can share screen, alan can talk, mike can hear, alan can see mike, can't hear Mike over GT... hm...
        I guess 30 minutes in... revert to ma bell..

    Alan here, 2nd time; working to get mike set...

    pytest working on both machines
    ran a few tests up to 4
    use mob git handover for collaboration
    each got to use own IDE
    python "match" requires 3.11
    2 hours, 2 participants
    used some rudimentary markdown for README.md
    used vertically split screen (Michael)
