## day 7
Tuesday. Day 7.
    Tuesday. .. mike could not her alan, nor see, maybe it was alan vpn; refresh GT and it seems to be working...

    GT sound is dead.... dunno why.. going with ma belll iPhone..

    GT sound works over Chrome, but A can't share screen (permissions). granted. Recap:
        Now on chrome, alan can share screen, alan can talk, mike can hear, alan can see mike, can't hear Mike over GT... hm...
